🚀 QField has officially hit **1 million downloads** – thanks to **you!** 🎉

Let's not beat around the bush: QField has hit **1+ million downloads**. What started as an ambitious open-source project has transformed into **a global tool that's changing how professionals collect spatial data in the field**. This big milestone is the result of years of dedication, with over 50,000 hours invested by our team. Our GeoNinjas contributed 14% of QGIS, while also driving open-source projects like _ModelBaker_ and _SwissLocator_.Thank you for making GIS nerds the **unsung heroes of fieldwork everywhere.** Here's to changing the world, one field at a time!

### The numbers tell a _story_ 📖

One million downloads might sound like just a number, but for us, it represents something much bigger. It's 1'000'000 times someone chose **an innovative, flexible mobile mapping solution**. It's 1’000’000 instances of fieldwork made **easier**, **more** **efficient**, and **more** **accurate**.

From humble beginnings to over 1 million downloads, QField has officially gone from “little app that could” to “open-source overachiever. **”** Thanks to the power of open source _(and probably some caffeine)_.
