For the first time we at OPENGIS.ch can celebrate with 2 people, Marco Bernasocchi and Matthias Kuhn both experienced QGIS developers and holders of a Master degree in GIScience.
After having worked individually in the last years, we have realized that there is a huge potential for us to join our knowledge - because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is why starting from January 1st, 2015 we are working together as OPENGIS.ch LLC.
Marco is the creator of QGIS for Android, has a strong background in python and web applications development and is core committer of the the award-winning InaSafe project.
Matthias is an active QGIS core committer with a long history in developing in a wide variety of programming languages and areas from embedded systems to server services.
We both are strong believers in open source software and are convinced that developing in the public is a big win for everybody.
Among other projects, we are currently working on QGIS Mobile. A touch optimized interface for field work, based on the QGIS libraries. Make sure you keep an eye on this project as it is in its infancy but growing very fast.
If you have a use-case for it and would like to support its development donâ€™t hesitate contacting us. We will happily provide you with a preview version.

We are are also available for helping you with any idea and project you might have and to give ad-hoc courses that cover topics related to (Q)GIS and programming.

All the best

Marco and Matthias
