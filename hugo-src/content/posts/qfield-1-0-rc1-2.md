It was a long and winding road but we are very excited to announce the general availability of QField 1.0 Release Candidate 1.

Packed with loads of useful features like online and offline features digitizing, geometry and attributes editing, attribute search, powerful forms, theme switching, GPS support, camera integration and much more, QField is the powerful tool for those who need to edit on the go and would like to avoid standing in the swamp with a laptop or paper charts.

With a slick user interface, QField allows using QGIS projects on tablets and mobile devices. Thanks to the QGIS rendering engine, the map-results are identical and come with the full range of styling possibilities available on the desktop.

We ask you to help us test as much as possible this Release Candidate so that we can iron out as many bugs as possible before the final release of QField 1.0.

You can easily install QField using the playstore ( [https://qfield.org/get](https://qfield.org/get)), find out more on the documentation site ( [https://qfield.org](https://qfield.org/)) and report problems to our issues tracking system ( [https://qfield.org/issues](https://qfield.org/issues))

QField, like QGIS, is an open source project. Everyone is welcome to contribute to make the product even better - whether it is with financial support, enthusiastic programming, translation and documentation work or visionary ideas.

If you want to help us build a better QField or QGIS, or need any services related to the whole QGIS stack donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.
