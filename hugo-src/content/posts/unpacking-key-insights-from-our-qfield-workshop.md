This year, **OPENGIS.ch** celebrated its 10th anniversary in Bern, with an afternoon full of workshops attended by clients, long-term friends, and colleagues. Here, we will give a glimpse of QField: **its vision, where it's headed**, and the **exciting features future users can look forward to**.

{{< figure src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD%5F4nXd1iGnLpJx5WxPML7HyLNR0DG1qVt2kLqVLYaoJtdE1Qf%5FhHmwDX9sQA9s5tpPz6qR6vDRu3GZAL6qiMA5KxviKArkc4DfxeWAO-lEd8byTMSAT9QS4%5FHe3FP9qzCSBUB2%5FwfaQ?key=JhsJzPrgTzxdKrRxZboFWtcn" alt="" caption="" >}}

QField was created on June 8th, 2011, with its first commit titled ‚Äú _added first script_‚Äù. Since then, it has grown into a powerful tool with a clear vision for the future: **to empower people to map and understand the world, tackle daily challenges, and address global issues.** Over the next ten years, QField aims to make this vision a reality for everyone, everywhere.

{{< figure src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD%5F4nXeI8nzlcXyBMSSx0nRLi3wZF-3ecV-VfNBeL036oq5KuTUlxOvkvNuA1FY2OgwG0FfzINh0uEdwZTuDxP1PaPFjLdllKy6nkHBH6lGslpd%5FQdTvtNSyJPdrtCYV83Gypf7CKyAD?key=JhsJzPrgTzxdKrRxZboFWtcn" alt="" caption="" >}}

Layers of cake, designed by QField ecosystem‚Äôs leading team members, were explained with 2034 in mind: intuitive and accessible to anyone wanting to map our world, while pioneering an innovative and collaborative app for the geospatial community. And last but not least: building strong and engaged communities to drive further adoption of the QField ecosystem.

This vision is taking shape through the forging of strategic partnerships with geospatial stakeholders: hardware manufacturers, ambassadors, trainers and technological partners. For the team, it is clear that good collaboration is **key to building a healthy and sustainable ecosystem**. Community as well as financial sustainability can become a strong reality with user groups, sponsors and crowdfundings.

And then it became reality: In the summer of 2024, heavy rains caused severe flooding in Switzerland and, suddenly, QField became a vital tool for supporting emergency response through data surveys and photo documentation.

With this emotional story, the technical lead, Mathieu took over and shared other QField **success stories** and **several mapping use cases** with partners in Finland and Tonga. But seamless fieldwork wouldn‚Äôt be possible without QFieldCloud, so Ivan provided an **insight into the last years‚Äô QFieldCloud enhancements**, before diving into the busy server-side roadmap for 2025, which includes **many new features** related to the authentication, security, internationalization and performance. Finally, Zsanett shared QField product **news and updates**, including new storage capacities like WebDAV and new packaging capabilities. Last but not least, the new Fangorn version introduces **new features developed by the evolving QField Community**.

Building communities by sharing thoughts and ideas for the ecosystem is now possible through the _**ideas.qfield.cloud**_ platform, open to everybody to suggest new ideas for QField.

The final topping of the (layer) cake: **the new QField plugin framework** was presented to the workshop attendees by Mathieu, who explained how the field workflow can be enhanced and optimized through the development of plugins ‚Äì **unique extensions that further personalize QField**. For example, with¬†the Routing Plugin, users can compute optimal ways between locations directly in QField using an external API. To make team efforts in the field even **more efficient**, the _Live Location Plugin_ allows each team member to see the location of other members on the QField map, preventing debilification in the field.

Last but not least, the workshop ended with a Q&A session, where several topics were addressed such as virtual reality, AI, machine learning, etc. This was followed by a happy and cheerful welcome drink with **OPENGIS.ch**partners. üçª
