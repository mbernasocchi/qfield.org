## Architecture fieldwork made simple

Use QField to check design intent, record deviations, and manage approvals. Forms and constraints mirror your QGIS model to keep data consistent.

### Key benefits
- Offline access to drawings and maps
- Photo and note capture linked to features
- Efficient supervision reports from synced data

## Works with QGIS and QFieldCloud

Prepare layers and forms in QGIS, then sync changes through QFieldCloud. Everyone sees the latest updates without email or USB handover.
