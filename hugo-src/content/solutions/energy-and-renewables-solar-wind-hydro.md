## Fieldwork for renewable assets
Map infrastructure, record conditions, and document issues with photos. Work fully offline and sync later with QFieldCloud.

### Typical workflows
- Pre-construction environmental and site surveys
- Construction QA and cable route verification
- O&M inspections, defects, and preventive maintenance

## Integrates with QGIS and QFieldCloud
Prepare layers and smart forms in QGIS. Share projects, collaborate, and sync changes via QFieldCloud.
