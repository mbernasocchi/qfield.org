## Field data for asset management
Collect accurate locations, attributes, and photos. Use domains and constraints for consistent records.

### Typical workflows
- Asset inventory and barcoding
- Condition surveys and maintenance logs
- Space and safety inspections

## Integrated with QGIS and QFieldCloud
Build your model in QGIS, then sync projects with QFieldCloud for smooth collaboration.
