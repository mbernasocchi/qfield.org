pains:
  - "Paper redlines slow construction handover"
  - "GPS drift and inconsistent measurements"
  - "Fragmented photos and evidence trails"

proof:
  - "Deployed by utilities and network contractors"
  - "Smooth handover from field to GIS/asset registers"

faq:
  - q: "Can we capture photos and tie them to features?"
    a: "Yes. Attach photos to features; metadata and geometry stay linked."
  - q: "Can we export into our asset system?"
    a: "Yes. Use GeoPackage/GeoJSON or pipelines to PostGIS; QFieldCloud automates sync."

## Who this is for
Network planners, construction crews, and QA teams delivering last-mile fibre. Keep planning, build, and as-built documentation aligned across office and field.

## What you can do
- Plan and **stake out** trench routes, cabinets, splitters, and drops  
- Collect **as-built** geometries with attributes and photo evidence  
- Validate constraints (IDs, port counts, splice rules) with **smart forms**  
- Work **offline** on site; sync changes and comments when back online  
- Export clean deliverables for GIS/asset systems

## Workflow
1) **Plan in QGIS:** layers for ducts, cables, chambers, OLT/ONT, rules and styles  
2) **Build with QField:** capture as-built lines/points, attach photos and notes  
3) **QA & Handover:** review in QFieldCloud, resolve conflicts, export to PostGIS/GeoPackage
