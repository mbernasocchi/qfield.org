faq:
  - q: "Does it work fully offline?"
    a: "Yes. Map, collect, and validate offline. Sync later via QFieldCloud with conflict-safe merges."
  - q: "Can we enforce taxonomy and codes?"
    a: "Yes. Use forms with domains and constraints to standardize entries across crews."

## Who this is for
Field crews, forest managers, and consultants who need reliable data capture in remote areas. QField pairs with QGIS so office and field use the same project, symbology, and rules.

## What you can do
- Capture trees, stands, plots, transects with **guided forms** and validation  
- Work **fully offline** with maps, forms, and basemaps on the device  
- Attach **photos/sketches/notes** to features for QA and evidence  
- Use **high-accuracy GNSS** and see live accuracy readouts  
- **Stake out**, snap, and edit geometries confidently  
- Sync safely with **QFieldCloud**; review, comment, and merge

## Workflow
1) **Prepare in QGIS:** data model, smart forms (constraints, defaults), symbology, offline basemaps  
2) **Survey in QField:** fast forms, media capture, optional survey-grade GNSS  
3) **Review in QFieldCloud:** conflict-safe merges, audit trail, exports to GeoPackage/PostGIS

## Next steps
