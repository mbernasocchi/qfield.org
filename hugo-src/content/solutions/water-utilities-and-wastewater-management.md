## Water and wastewater fieldwork
Map pipes, valves, hydrants, manholes, and treatment facilities. Capture photos and notes linked to each feature.

### Typical workflows
- Valve exercising and hydrant inspections
- Sewer manhole surveys and condition assessments
- Leak detection and repair documentation

## Integrated with QGIS and QFieldCloud
Design forms in QGIS, then sync and collaborate with QFieldCloud to keep asset data current.
